css

Nothing stands out as bad. Only note I would make is that everything except font size is in px,
which is completely unresponsive. You import bootstrap for a lot of your css behaviour though, so
that's less of an issue.

html

I like your page design, though I would make the left column smaller and the right bigger, as the
focus should be on the messages.

Javascript

Line 8-16: I'm unclear as to the point of this. You might want to comment this more. I think it's
suppose to let a message appear to inform me of success sending a post or failure, but if so it
disappears so fast I never see it.

Line 28-33: It's clearly suppose to reload the page so you catch your new posts, but it seems to
happen so fast that doesn't always happen. You could put a delay on it of three or four seconds,
or you could just periodically reload the page automatically to catch all new entries.
