# Connect Four

Conect4 is based on the original Connect Four boardgame built with Python. Pair-programmed and built with Python based on the principles of the MVC framework and unittests.

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. Connect Four is a strongly solved game. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)
