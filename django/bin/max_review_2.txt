* L1 of about.html && index.html should be killed, your base should include that.
* L16 - L21, L49 - L62 rather than using an HTML comment, use a django template comment. This will prevent it from render so the browser will never see it.
* L6 - L23 - ideally you should go ahead and put this as a template block called `header`, or better yet multiple blocks named, `meta`, `css`, `javasript` this way you can overide via completly blocking them or adding to them based on the needs of a template that’s extending base.html
* L23, there’s no need for this if L6 - L23 become new blocks
* If you plan on taking this further, i.e. making this public, consider breaking your templates down further. Consider how could all of your apps extend from base, and add their needed JS and CSS

Changes annotated below. Thanks for the heads-up about using Django comments instead of html comments. 


home/urls.py:
no action taken as we discussed, the import is needed


html_portfolio/urls.py:
L2 — commented-out “from django.contrib import admin” for potential use later


home/base.html:
L49-62 — removed old commented-out html


home/about.html:
L1 — removed “<!DOCTYPE html>”
L16 — removed old commented-out html
L21 — removed old commented-out html


Many changes have been implemented since the last review. New additions include:

html_portfolio/urls.py:
‘namespace’ defined to distinguish the javapic app versus javapic jQuery

home/base
There are now several base html templates: metadata, css_links, and js_scripts. As suggested in the previous review, this provides the flexibility for each app to utilize these base templates when extending the base.html. 

Within base.html there are now additional django block tags providing inheritance options for the metadata, css_links, title, navbar_subtext, and the js_scripts on top of the base html templates listed above. 

The project now has a consistent navbar and footer throughout each app.  

Let me know, if I can help with anything. Thanks again for the help.
